# Factorial Feature

## Overview
In this project, you will use test-driven development to build a factorial method. You will use the assert module and mocha testing library to drive your development using tests that follow the phases: setup, exercise, and verification.

### How to Calculate Factorial 
You take an integer and you multiply that by all the integers that are less than it.
The factorial of an integer `n` is denoted by an exclamation mark `n!`, so `5!` is equal to:

 `5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`
