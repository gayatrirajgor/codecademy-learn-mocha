# Rooster regulation

## Overview 
An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! It’s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the `rooster` is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.

## Technologies 💻
+ JavaScript
+ [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (describe-it blocks)
+ Node assertions
+ Phases of a good test (setup, exercise, verify, teardown)

## Key Learnings 🏆
+ I wrote four tests across two methods on one object, and the tests run **fast** because the implementation is brief and basic.
+ The tests are **complete** because the four tests cover the full rooster and its methods.
+ They are **reliable** because I always receive the same result when I run `npm test`.
+ They are **isolated** since neither test is dependent on any other test.
+ They are **expressive** because I utilised descriptive strings to make the result messages easier to read.
